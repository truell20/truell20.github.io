Hello, my name is Michael Truell. I am a high school student at [Horace Mann](http://www.horacemann.org/) in New York City and an intern at [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com/), a quantative hedge fund, where I am building [an AI challenge](https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite). 

In my spare time, I create robots, program websites, and tinker with deep neural networks (see [projects](/projects)). I love to run and do so competitvely, in addition to co-heading my school's American Computer Science League team, programming club, and FRC team.
